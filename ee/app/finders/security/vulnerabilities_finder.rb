# Security::VulnerabilitiesFinder
#
# Used to filter Vulnerability records for Vulnerabilities API
#
# Arguments:
#   vulnerable: any object that has a #vulnerabilities method that returns a collection of `Vulnerability`s
#   params: optional! a hash with one or more of the following:
#     project_ids: if `vulnerable` includes multiple projects (like a Group), this filter will restrict
#                   the vulnerabilities returned to those in the group's projects that also match these IDs
#     include_archived_projects: defaulted to `false`. Determines if results will include vulnerabilities
#                                 associated with archived projects
#     image: only return vulnerabilities with these location images
#     report_types: only return vulnerabilities from these report types
#     severities: only return vulnerabilities with these severities
#     states: only return vulnerabilities in these states
#     has_resolution: only return vulnerabilities that have resolution
#     has_issues: only return vulnerabilities that have issues linked
#     sort: return vulnerabilities ordered by severity_asc or severity_desc
