#   What does this test do
#
#   This is an e2e test that doesnt manage / orchestrate KAS / agentk / gitlab but expects them to be up and running.
#   This test is currently quarantined and its used for local testing by the engineers
#   This can be removed in the fututre when we have a better approach for local testing
#
#   How to setup the test
#
#   1. Follow this documentation to set up your local GDK environment for creating remote development workspaces:
#      https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/remote-development/gitlab-remote-development-docs/-/blob/main/doc/local-development-environment-setup.md
#   2. Ensure that you can successfully create and terminate workspaces in your local GDK environment. (It can also be
#      run against other environments if the setup for remote dev agent and devfile project has been setup already)
#   3. Call the helper script at `scripts/remote_development/run-e2e-tests.sh`.
#      If you used all the default suggested group/project/agent values in the documentation above, the default values
#      should work for you. Otherwise, any variable can be overridden on the command line, for example:
#
#      DEVFILE_PROJECT="devfile-test-project" AGENT_NAME="test-agent" scripts/remote_development/run-e2e-tests.sh
